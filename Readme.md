## Updated in 04/2016
This is a summer intern project I worked on in Beihang mentored by Xibo Wu (author of cocoa simulator) and Prof. Lei Wang in 2011. This project is tightly related to OS course project where we built couple simple OS components during previous semester. I must say this project is a super interesting and super exciting project. It is a few project and course in Beihang which is dedicated designed for study purpose and where you can learn a huge amount of cool stuff. One bug, aslo mentioned in following docs, in this project, which took me couple days to analyze and eventually solve, played a critical role in my later years, 2 or 3 at least. By explainning it to interviewers, it made a big difference and luckily brought me chances and offers.

So in short, what I want say is, what you learnt from a project is much more important than what score/gpa you got from it. Please don't deceive yourself otherwise I'll feel guilty to upload it to github. 

Following is the index and docs I wrote in 2011 summer. Hope it can help. Please feel free to contact me if you get any question or feedback.
